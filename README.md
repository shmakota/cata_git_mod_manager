## Features

- Custom mod install directory â€“ Set your own path to where mods are installed.

## How It Works

1. Set your mod install folder â€“ Define where you want mods to be installed.
2. Create one or more profiles â€“ Each profile can have a different mod loadout.
3. Add mod repos â€“ Input GitHub URLs pointing to mod or modpack repositories.
4. One-click update â€“ The tool pulls the latest versions of all mods from the defined GitHub sources.
5. Automatic scanning â€“ The tool locates all valid mods via their `modinfo.json`, even in nested subfolders.

## Ideal For

- Players who use multiple mod combinations.
- Those who want to stay up to date with community mods.
- Modpack creators looking to manage modular updates.
- Developers or tinkerers who want to explore mod content in-depth.

## Requirements

Requires Python3, everything else should automatically be setup by the install script.

## Installation

As of 1.0.2, mod explorer functionality is included by default in this repo and the mod explorer repo has been discontinued.

## Compatibility
